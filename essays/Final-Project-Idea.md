## Overview
THe problem: The UH Department of Sustainability does not have an efficient method of recording, storing, and visualizing the data they collect. 

The solution: we designed an app called "Gather" which streamlines the recording, storing, and visualization of waste audit data.

## Approach
In app, there are three levels of users present: basic, organization, and admin. Their interaction with app will take care of mondane tasks and streamline the data collection process.

Some mockup pages include:
 - Landing page
 - User home page
 - Admin home page

First, an admin will create a "Study", where they define the categories of waste they would like to keep track of at waste audits. After the study has begun, the fields can no longer be edited. This allows researchers the flexibility to keep track of any number of data classes while also maintaing the integrity of the data.

Once a study is created, organizations can create "events", where users can register so that points may be awarded for participation and may see other users and network with them. Once the event concludes, the data may be saved in a database in an organized manner where users can view it using charts and graphs available in our app.

## Use case ideas
 - Organization: registers new event, organizes new event and at the conclusion of the event they submit their audit data and it closes the event.
 - New users: Sign up and verify UH email, are able to view and register events and can view other users.
 - Admin: Can take down past events, remove user/org accounts that are "dead".

## Beyond the basics
  In the futute, we could implement a shop where students could redeem points earned from various events.  Could support a contacts list and implement a serverside messaging system between users.  Implement a student leader level user who could communicate with organizations about the scheduling and semantics of events.
