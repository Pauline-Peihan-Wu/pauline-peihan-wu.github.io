We all needs help sometimes in our daliy live. No matter is for school, class, homework or life in general, or some difficult things, 
it is really important to the effective help from others.

When learning programming or deal with technical things, we always emcounter some problems which may need help from some expert. Majority 
of people choose to go online and post their question in some kind forum and hope someone will answer their questions. However, not 
everyone who posted the question will get a good and detailed answer. It will all depends on how you word your questions.

## How to ask a question smartly?

In order to get the good and detailed response from someone, you need to ask your question in a smart way. So you have at least try to 
solve the problem by yourself first. Such ways to do it is: search online, look in the manual or the FAQ and try to find the answer. The 
reason you need to do this is so that when you write you question, you can say that you have tried these ways but still could not solve 
the problem. Then when people see your question, they will know you are not a lazy person, you tried your best to find the solution. 

I think no one wants to help someone who just want someone else to provide them the answer without doing any work. Plus you do not anything
if you do try to understand the problem by yourself first. Also, if you do not know where the problem is, how will you ask someone to help
you. From my own experience, sometimes when you try to solve the problem on your own, you might end up get the correct answer. It may not 
be as hard as you think. 

Do additional work to try to solve your problem will not hurt you. However, if the question you posted online make people think you are a 
lazy person who just want straight anwser, you will get some offended answers. Which could destroy your good mood or cause you lose temp. 
Well, the best way to response to this is do not care about the reply too much. But we should still try to work hard and ask question in a 
smart way! This kind of way to ask question will also benefit us in a long run.
