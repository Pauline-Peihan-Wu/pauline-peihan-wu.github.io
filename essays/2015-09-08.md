## What is a "Zone"?

For me, "Zone" will be a place for a subject where most of the professionals are at. Thinking about the past two years, I completed the intro level classes and lower level classes of the Computer Science Degree. Now, starting this semester, I begin to take the upper level classes which will take me to another level of programming by the end of the school year. This process will slowly take me into the "Zone" of the Computer Science. And I will eventually learn more about different kinds of programming languages and be more proficient when writing code to create project. 

## New level, but similar concepts
