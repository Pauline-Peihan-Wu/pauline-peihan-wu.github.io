## What is a "Zone"?

For me, "Zone" will be a place for a subject where most of the professionals are at. Thinking about the past two years, I completed the intro level classes and lower level classes of the Computer Science Degree. Now, starting this semester, I begin to take the upper level classes which will take me to another level of programming by the end of the school year. This process will slowly take me into the "Zone" of the Computer Science. And I will eventually learn more about different kinds of programming languages and be more proficient when writing code to create project. 

## New level, but similar concepts

Software Engineering is a new concept for me. I have no idea what I am about to get into before the first class. As we start to learn Javascript in ICS 314, I think this programming language is similar to the ones I learned but make you have to think differently. Also, it is not that easy to get A in this class because you have to keep up the work and do well on most of the work, no matter is a homework or classwork. Which shows that, once you enter the "Zone", you have to push yourself to be better. It does not mean you are safe now. So with that being said, I have to work hard and strive for excellence!
