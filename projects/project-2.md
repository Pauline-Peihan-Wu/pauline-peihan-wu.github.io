After having some knowledge of Java, the professor assigned us another project. The project origanially called Zombie because the example professor provide is Zombie theme. The professor did not say the project we create have to be zombie theme so I chose to use Mario as my theme for the game. 

This time I was actually better on coding the game. The purpose of it is that Mario is running away from the fire bro. Mario can place blocks so the fire bro will slow down. There is only certain amount of blocks Mario can drop. When Mario get more mushroom, he will be able to drop more blocks. I also added background  music. When the game start, the music willl play. For this project, I got help from my TA and I also went to the ICSpace to get help. Which really helped me so much. I was so exciting when I saw my final project and I played it several times, too.
