## HACC 2020

Hawaii Annual Code Challenge is a competition that is being hold every year in the fall. Many people in Hawaii will participate


## Overview

Ku Ka'awale (to stand apart) is a web application designed to visualize campus occupancy. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for the eventual transition back into in-person learning, the application is designed to identify patterns of use in buildings across campus through the sampling of the WiFi management and obtaining anonymized data. This project hopes to recognize patterns of campus activities scheduled and unscheduled, to improve future scheduling, reduce the spread of COVID-19 on campus, and increase the efficiency of campus scheduling procedures and operations.

## Web App Features

When you first visit the page, you will be greeted by our Landing Page!

Currenly, our application does not require user to create account or login. So once you go the page, you will see there is a page where user can view the current occupancy of the buildings on campus. And there is another page which shows the history of the buidling occupancy, so it will be better to monitor what time different buildings would be reach peak occupancy.

Below are the pages of the app:
