This is the very first project I have made since I started to learn how to write code. The project itself might look really easy. But I've put in lots of work into it to create it successfully. 

In the beginning, I was struggling with so many things, like how to create this, how to place this button here, and more. I actually went to get help from the TA several time before I fully understand what I should do and what are the ways I can do them. After finish this project, I was so happy and proud about myself making my first game. It felt so good.
