This is the final project of my ICS 111 class. It was a project that we have to work in groups to make it. There so many different ideas about the project. After some discussion, my group decided to make a Tower Defense game. I was confuse about this game in the beginning because I never see this kind of game before. 

In my group, there was a guy. He is really good at programming. He is the person who sugguested Tower Defense. He even had a code about finding path from left top corner to right bottom corner with obstacle randomly generated in between. It obviously required lots of code. 

After we have an idea about what game we were making, we divded the work for the project. I am in control of the map part. One person is doing the enemy. One is doing the defense tower. The guy who sugguested the idea do the rest. He was also helping us when we got stuck. The hardest part for programming with group of people is to combine the code at the end so the game will work. Luckily, we found an online place where we can upload code and configirate the old code with the new old. It is lots of work but it works. The map part was not too bad. I mad it that when user place the tower on the path create in the beginning, the path will change. 

Our professor looked over all the different project we submitted. During the last lecture, he announced the top three project from his opinion. And my group got the first place. We got a price because of it. It was a good experience.

Here is the link to a video of this game: [Tower Defense](https://youtu.be/fdkGsH0faVI).

More information about the code of this project will coming soon.
