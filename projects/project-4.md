Gather is a web application my group created for the ICS 314 Final Project. It was my first time develop a web application. 

It all started when we went to the 2018 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC). After all five presenter presented their challenges, we kind decided to do the Waste Audit Challenge. We thought it would be easy since we just need to make the website able to desplay all the data that are inputed by user/admin. 

However, it was not that easy. Because we are not use to the new software we just learned, it took a long time to do the research about how to implement the back-end stuff. After weeks and days of hard-working, we were able to submit our final product on time and suprisely we got to present in front of all the judges. Although we did not get any awards, it was already a fantastic exprience.

So because we participate in the HACC, we were able use our project for the Final project of the ICS 314 class. Even though we started earlier than everyone else in the class, we still spend lots of time to try to make all the back-end function work and make sure thing at front-end is connecting with the back-end. This was not a easy process, but when things able to work the way you want, you feel accomplished.

Overall, it was a great experience and an amazing semester. I was able to learn new software and also made lots of awesome friends.
